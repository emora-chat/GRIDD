Untested

dep
raise
modal
    modal and raise all do similar things????
    why is
    i should study -> modal should
    but
    i ought to study -> raise ought
acl

Handled but weird
-----------
conj
com
prt
voc
prn
advcl
    -> have general advcl but drops "if" information bc "if" is mark
        so maybe need to have another rule for advcl + mark for this?
disc
    -> only handled when disc is to yes,no,ok

Not handled
-----------
relcl
r-*
    need rules to many current constructions that
    handle if relcl and r-* are present too


TO DO
---------
aux
    use aux to determine time aspect for certain verb pos not currently handled, not as mode predicate!!

vbp verb on its own means mode = habitual!!!

one of the comp rules is redundant, it can be handled with just the plain nsubj verb rules!!!

need to have question handling
    -> insert relative ordering between spans (?) and check if aux/modal/raise come before subject

(1) First sarah went to the store then she bought a banana
    -> Need sentence segmentation

[[2, "adv"], [2, "nsbj"], [8, "comp"], [5, "case"], [5, "det"],
[2, "ppmod"], [8, "adv"], [8, "nsbj"], [-1, "root"], [10, "det"],
[8, "obj"]]

(2) Mary said goodbye to you
    -> Not `disc` but hello is?

[[1, "nsbj"], [-1, "root"], [1, "obj"], [4, "case"], [1, "ppmod"]]

(3)

I like when you have vacuumed the house

    ["PRP", "VBP",
    "WRB", "PRP", "VBP", "VBN", "DT", "NN"]
    [1, "nsbj"], [-1, "root"],
    [5, "adv"], [5, "nsbj"], [5, "aux"], [1, "comp"], [7, "det"], [5, "obj"]

(4) Not sure why we had this one???

obj(X/pos(), Y/pos())
-> floating_obj ->
p/obj(X,Y)
center(Y)
focus(p)
;
